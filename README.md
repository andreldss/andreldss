## 👋 Hey, I'm André

Aspiring full-stack developer, mainly working with Next.js, React, TypeScript, Firebase, and MySQL, but I enjoy exploring different areas of programming.

I love bringing ideas to life. Working on a project, designing the flow, shaping it piece by piece.. that process really draws me in.

Currently working at Copobras S/A as a Junior Software Developer.
